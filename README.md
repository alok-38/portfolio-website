## About The Project

![Screen Shot](./assets/images/Screenshot2.png)

I decided to keep a portfolio site ready with dummy projects as placeholders. I will start to
fill in the projects section with contents as soon as I have a couple of solid projects to showcase.

## Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

## Getting Started

This is not bootstrapped with any JS frame work. This is a pure JS project.

## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

- If you have suggestions for adding or removing projects, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/alok-38/ReadME-Generator/issues/new) to discuss it, or directly create a pull request after you edit the _README.md_ file with necessary changes.
- Please make sure you check your spelling and grammar.
- Create individual PR for each suggestion.
- Please also read through the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/alok-38/ReadME-Generator/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before posting your first idea as well.
